# Work Day Scheduler 

This is a basic daily work agenda using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and a few api libraries (bootstrap, jQuery, Google Fonts, etc).

The purpose of this assignment was to build a daily agenda that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
